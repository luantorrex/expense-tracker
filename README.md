# Expense Tracker

A simple but effective expense tracker where users can add expenses, categorize them, and see a summary of their spending. The application may include a basic chart or graph to visualize expenses over time.

## Features

- **Add Expenses:** Record individual expenses with amounts, descriptions, and categories.
- **Categorization:** Organize expenses into custom categories (e.g., food, transportation, utilities).
- **Summary View:** See a summary of total spending by category or over a specified period.
- **Visualization:** Optionally view charts or graphs for a quick look at spending trends.
- **Remove and Filter Expenses:** Delete expenses by ID and filter them by category or by date range.

## Usage

The repository contains a basic TypeScript project. After installing dependencies and running the build script, you can execute the example application:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Running `npm start` will execute the compiled JavaScript in `dist/index.js`, which demonstrates adding an expense and printing a summary.
You can modify `src/index.ts` to experiment with removing expenses or filtering them by category and date range.
