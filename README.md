# Expense Tracker

A simple but effective expense tracker where users can add expenses, categorize them, and see a summary of their spending. The application may include a basic chart or graph to visualize expenses over time.

## Features

- **Add Expenses:** Record individual expenses with amounts, descriptions, and categories.
- **Categorization:** Organize expenses into custom categories (e.g., food, transportation, utilities).
- **Summary View:** See a summary of total spending by category or over a specified period.
- **Visualization:** Optionally view charts or graphs for a quick look at spending trends.

## Usage

The repository contains a basic TypeScript project setup. To build the project, install dependencies and run the build script:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript source from `src/` into JavaScript in the `dist/` directory. The application entry point is `src/index.ts`.
